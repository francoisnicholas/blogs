This article explores the evolution of Israel’s foreign policy, examining its military posture, diplomatic strategies, and economic initiatives in the context of current conflicts, including the ongoing Israel-Hamas war (2023-present) and military operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah (2024). Israel’s foreign policy is shaped by a delicate balance of hard and soft power, relying on military superiority, U.S. support, and regional diplomacy, such as the Abraham Accords (2020). This article analyzes how these strategies have allowed Israel to maintain its dominance while addressing internal and external challenges. Despite Israel’s military and diplomatic successes, ongoing regional tensions and international pressures continue to constrain its policy decisions.

## Introduction

The formation of Israel in 1948 initiated a complex and often contentious relationship with its neighbors. Since then, Israel has actively navigated regional threats through military strength, diplomatic initiatives, and economic strategies. Israel’s foreign policy has continuously adapted to regional and global dynamics, all while maintaining its security. Recent developments, such as the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict (2023-present), the Lebanon operations of 2024, and the Abraham Accords (2020), demonstrate the evolving and dynamic nature of Israel’s foreign policy. Zanotti and Sharp (2024) state that “Israel’s foreign policy is primarily driven by the need to ensure military superiority while managing diplomatic relations with both regional actors and global powers.” This article analyzes how Israel’s military posture, soft and hard power strategies, diplomatic efforts, and economic approaches have shaped its foreign policy in response to these events. Through this analysis, the article assesses how these elements continue to shape Israel’s role in the ongoing Middle East conflict.

## Balance of Power

Since its inception, Israel has maintained its military superiority in the Middle East by forming strategic alliances and leveraging advanced technology, despite significant shifts in the region’s balance of power. The Israel-Hamas war highlights the importance of this dominance. As Hirsh (2024) notes, “Israel’s technological advancements, particularly in the defense sector, have been critical in maintaining its qualitative military edge.” This edge is further strengthened by substantial U.S. military aid, which is essential for sustaining Israel’s strategic control in the region.

In response to the ongoing conflict, Israel has actively demonstrated its readiness to engage on multiple fronts against Hamas. ACLED (2024) points out Israel’s capacity to “escalate its military actions in Gaza and Lebanon to counteract regional threats.” By employing advanced intelligence and technology, Israel continues to outpace adversaries such as Hamas and Hezbollah (Zanotti & Sharp, 2024). The escalation in Lebanon also shows Israel’s strategic posture, as it responds to Hezbollah’s actions with considerable force to maintain regional stability.

## Military Posture

Israel has significantly expanded its military capabilities since its early years, positioning itself to respond effectively to a wide range of threats. The Israel-Hamas conflict (2023-present) has critically tested Israel’s military readiness. Collinson (2024) highlights, “Israel’s ground operations in Gaza reflect its readiness to act decisively, despite calls for restraint from global actors like the United States.” Israel’s proactive military posture, including preemptive strikes, plays a central role in its defense strategy.

The escalating tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon (2024) further tested Israel’s military strength. Zanotti and Sharp (2024) emphasize that “American assistance has been instrumental in developing key Israeli defense systems such as Iron Dome and David’s Sling, which provide a technological edge.” These systems were highly effective during the Gaza conflict, intercepting a large number of rockets and demonstrating Israel’s capacity to protect its population while neutralizing threats (AJC, 2024). Israel’s reliance on advanced defense technologies reflects its commitment to maintaining military superiority in the region.

## Soft Power Strategies

Israel’s hard power is well-known, but its soft power strategies play an equally crucial role in shaping global perceptions. The Abraham Accords (2020), which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states, marked a major soft power victory. Dostri (2024) states that “Israel has leveraged diplomatic successes like the Abraham Accords to counterbalance the negative narratives that often surround its military actions.” The Accords not only created new diplomatic pathways but also helped reframe Israel as a nation committed to peaceful coexistence.

However, the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict poses significant challenges to preserving Israel’s soft power. The war has attracted international criticism and strained Israel’s ties with global powers. Wooden (2024) highlights the impact on Israel’s relationship with the Vatican, noting that “the Vatican has been critical of Israel’s military actions, which has led to a war of words between the two.” This underscores the difficulty Israel encounters in balancing military actions with positive diplomacy, especially as global narratives tend to shift against it during conflict.

## Hard Power Application

Israel consistently employs hard power to confront perceived threats, particularly from neighboring countries and non-state actors like Hamas and Hezbollah. The Israel-Hamas conflict exemplifies this strategy. ACLED (2024) notes, “Israel has frequently escalated its military responses in Gaza and Lebanon, illustrating its commitment to using force as a primary tool of foreign policy.” This method defines Israel’s defense strategy, aiming to neutralize threats before they escalate.

Ongoing military operations in southern Lebanon against Hezbollah highlight Israel’s readiness to extend its military reach. Collinson (2024) stresses, “Israel’s military operations in southern Lebanon are a key part of its broader hard power strategy to disrupt Iran’s influence in the region.” These actions reflect Israel’s determination to prevent Hezbollah from gaining strength, especially with the risk of Iran-backed forces destabilizing the region.

The Israel-Hamas war draws significant attention to Israel’s hard power tactics, with extensive airstrikes and ground operations targeting Hamas’s military infrastructure. Sanger (2024) explains, “Israel’s airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza are part of a broader strategy to degrade Hamas’s military capabilities and prevent future attacks.” However, the humanitarian toll of these operations has sparked international criticism, complicating Israel’s long-term reliance on hard power.

## Diplomatic Approaches

Israel has significantly advanced its diplomatic efforts, particularly through the Abraham Accords (2020), despite its reliance on military force. Zanotti and Sharp (2024) emphasize the Accords’ success, noting they have “opened new avenues for diplomatic and economic cooperation between Israel and several Arab states.” These agreements mark a notable shift in regional dynamics as Israel strengthens alliances with former adversaries.

Yet, resolving the Palestinian issue remains a significant challenge, especially amidst the current Israel-Hamas conflict. Wooden (2024) underscores how the conflict “has strained Israel’s diplomatic relations, particularly with countries critical of its military actions,” complicating Israel’s efforts to secure broader support for its policies as international pressure increases for a peaceful solution to the Palestinian issue.

The United States continues to be a critical diplomatic partner for Israel, especially in managing the escalating situation in Lebanon and Gaza. The Congressional Research Service highlights how U.S. diplomatic support remains crucial in brokering peace agreements and mitigating the consequences of Israel’s military actions. “The United States continues to play a central role in facilitating Israel’s diplomatic efforts, particularly in brokering peace agreements with Arab states” (Zanotti & Sharp, 2024). However, the path to a comprehensive peace agreement with the Palestinians remains elusive.

## Economic Strategies

Israel aligns its economic strategy with its military and diplomatic efforts. U.S. military aid, amounting to approximately $3.3 billion annually, is a key pillar of Israel’s economic and defense policy (AJC, 2024). This aid has enabled Israel to finance essential defense initiatives, including missile defense systems such as Iron Dome and David’s Sling, which have been crucial in protecting Israeli civilians from rocket attacks during the ongoing conflict (AJC, 2024).

Beyond U.S. aid, Israel has capitalized on its economic partnerships to expand its regional influence. As Hirsh (2024) notes, “Israel’s trade relationships, particularly with Europe and Asia, have been instrumental in enhancing its economic position.” These partnerships not only yield economic benefits but also fortify Israel’s diplomatic relationships, creating a network of alliances that reinforce its broader foreign policy goals.

Moreover, Israel’s flourishing technology sector has become a key element of its economic strategy. “Israel’s reputation as a tech hub has attracted significant foreign investment, further bolstering its economic and diplomatic ties” (Hirsh, 2024). This economic strength has provided Israel with the resources to sustain its military efforts and advance its foreign policy objectives, especially amid the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon.

## Constraints on Israeli Foreign Policy

Israel, despite its strengths, faces considerable limitations on its foreign policy. Domestically, political divisions hinder decision-making, especially regarding the Palestinian issue. Walt (2024) explains that “internal political pressures, especially from nationalist factions, limit Israel’s ability to make concessions in peace negotiations.” These domestic challenges prevent Israel from pursuing a unified and consistent foreign policy, particularly concerning the Palestinian territories.

Internationally, Israel confronts pressure from organizations like the United Nations and the International Criminal Court. Walt (2024) notes that “Israel’s military actions in Gaza have drawn scrutiny from international bodies, leading to potential legal challenges.” These legal pressures, alongside increasing international criticism, significantly impact Israel’s foreign policy, particularly as it strives to balance military actions with preserving international legitimacy.

The Israel-Hamas conflict has further strained Israel’s relationships with key allies. Although the United States continues to offer strong support, other nations have been more critical of Israel’s military operations, particularly regarding civilian casualties and the humanitarian situation (Sanger, 2024). This criticism creates a serious challenge for Israel as it seeks to safeguard its security while managing its international relationships.

## Conclusion

Israel’s foreign policy intricately combines military strength, economic alliances, and diplomatic strategies. Zanotti and Sharp (2024) highlight that Israel’s approach continually adapts to regional threats, economic demands, and global diplomatic interactions. The ongoing conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah illustrate the difficulties Israel encounters while managing these competing priorities.

Looking ahead, Israel will likely prioritize preserving its military dominance while pursuing diplomatic resolutions to its conflicts. Sanger (2024) stresses that “Israel’s ability to balance hard and soft power will be critical in shaping its future in the Middle East.” Ultimately, Israel’s foreign policy will be instrumental in shaping the region’s future stability.
