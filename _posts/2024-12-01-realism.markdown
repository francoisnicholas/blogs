This article argues that while realism offers valuable insights into international relations, particularly in explaining power politics and state competition, it falls short in addressing the complexities introduced by globalization, the rise of non-state actors, and transnational challenges such as climate change and terrorism. Stephen Walt’s assertion that realism simplifies understanding global politics holds true in many contexts, especially regarding state-centric behavior and geopolitical rivalries like that of the U.S. and China. However, modern international relations demand a broader approach that includes liberal and constructivist perspectives, emphasizing the importance of multilateralism, international cooperation, and the use of both hard and soft power, as outlined by Joseph Nye. To navigate the complexities of today’s globalized world, realism must evolve and integrate with these other frameworks, providing a more comprehensive understanding of contemporary global issues.

## Introduction  
International relations theory provides a variety of frameworks to help us interpret global politics. Realism, one of the most influential theories, focuses on power, national interest, and the competitive nature of state interactions in an anarchic international system. Stephen Walt, in his article *The World Wants You to Think Like a Realist*, argues that realism remains an essential lens through which we can understand global politics. Walt asserts, “If you do think like a realist — at least part of the time — many confusing aspects of world politics become easier to understand” (Walt, 2018). Realism has long guided the foreign policy of powerful states, including the United States. However, while realism offers clarity on power politics and state behavior, it falls short when addressing the complexities of globalization, the rise of non-state actors, and the need for multilateralism. This article argues that realism explains certain aspects of modern international relations, but modern global challenges demand a more comprehensive framework that incorporates liberal and constructivist perspectives alongside realist theory.

## The Core Tenets of Realism and Their Historical Context  
Realism, at its core, assumes that states operate in an anarchic international system where the primary goal is to maximize power and ensure survival. This competition for power, driven by national interest, forms the basis of realist thought. Hans Morgenthau, one of the leading figures in modern realism, famously stated, “International politics, like all politics, is a struggle for power” (Morgenthau, 1948). This view reflects the reality that states prioritize their security and seek to accumulate power to protect themselves in a world without a central authority. Historically, this framework shaped U.S. foreign policy in critical moments.

For example, U.S. expansionism during the late 19th century, particularly during the Spanish-American War, exemplifies how realism informed American foreign policy. The U.S. engaged in territorial expansion by annexing the Philippines and Puerto Rico, driven by the desire to project power and secure economic interests in strategic regions (Benbow, 2012). Realism’s focus on securing power and national interest justified these interventions as necessary to enhance U.S. influence globally.

Similarly, U.S. foreign policy during World War II was deeply rooted in realist thinking. The U.S. strategically positioned itself as a dominant global power by forming military alliances, such as NATO, and creating international institutions like the United Nations to ensure stability favorable to its national interests. The Marshall Plan, aimed at rebuilding war-torn Europe, also served U.S. interests by preventing the spread of communism and promoting economic recovery (Gallicchio, 2012). These policies reflected the core realist idea that power must be preserved through economic and military means.

Stephen Walt builds on these historical examples, asserting that realism continues to be an essential framework for understanding global politics. Walt emphasizes that realism “focuses on the enduring forces of power and interest, which are often overlooked by other approaches” (Walt, 2018). Realism explains state actions such as military interventions, diplomatic alliances, and economic sanctions as tools to maximize power in an anarchic world. For Walt, this realist lens helps clarify complex geopolitical decisions, making it easier to understand global conflicts and alliances.

## Realism’s Application in the Post-War International System  
In the aftermath of World War II, U.S. foreign policy reflected a mix of realism and emerging liberal ideals. While the U.S. sought to counter Soviet influence through realist strategies such as containment, it also pursued international cooperation to shape the global economic order. The establishment of institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank ensured that the U.S. could exert influence while maintaining economic stability. The Marshall Plan, a massive U.S. initiative to rebuild Western Europe, is a key example of how realist and liberal policies overlapped. The plan not only helped prevent the spread of communism but also restored economic growth in Europe, benefiting both the region and the U.S. economy (Gallicchio, 2012).

During the Cold War, the U.S. applied realist strategies through the policy of containment, which sought to limit Soviet expansion. This strategy, articulated in the Truman Doctrine, established the U.S. as the primary defender of the free world, a position that required the U.S. to act decisively in global affairs (Roberts, 2012). The Korean War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Vietnam War all exemplified realist concerns with maintaining a balance of power and curbing Soviet influence. The Cuban Missile Crisis in particular showed how nuclear deterrence — a hallmark of realist strategy — served as the ultimate tool for avoiding direct conflict while still asserting dominance.

Joseph Nye, however, critiques realism’s narrow focus on military power, emphasizing that power in the 21st century is more diffuse. In his essay *Get Smart*, Nye argues that “America cannot solve the most pressing problems on our own,” pointing to the necessity of combining hard power with soft power to address global issues (Nye, 2009). Nye’s concept of “smart power” offers an alternative to pure realist thinking by suggesting that military might alone is insufficient in a world where cultural, economic, and ideological influence matters just as much. The post-war international system thus reflects a blend of realist power politics and liberal cooperation, as the U.S. sought to shape global affairs through both military alliances and multilateral institutions.

## Realism’s Relevance in the 21st Century: The U.S.-China Rivalry  
In the 21st century, realism remains relevant in understanding state behavior, particularly in the growing rivalry between the U.S. and China. As China rises economically and militarily, the U.S. has responded by reinforcing alliances in the Indo-Pacific, engaging in trade wars, and increasing its military presence in the region. Stephen Walt notes that rising powers inevitably challenge established powers, and the U.S.-China relationship exemplifies this dynamic (Walt, 2018). China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which seeks to expand Chinese influence through infrastructure development across Asia, Africa, and Europe, is viewed by many in the U.S. as a strategic threat.

Realism helps explain the U.S. response to China’s rise. The U.S. has sought to counterbalance China’s growing influence by strengthening its alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and other countries in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. has also imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, initiated trade disputes, and increased its military presence in the South China Sea to assert its dominance. These actions reflect the realist belief that power politics remains central to international relations and that states must act to preserve their security and influence in an anarchic world.

## The Limits of Realism in Addressing Global Challenges  
While realism provides valuable insights into state behavior and power politics, it is limited in addressing the complex, transnational challenges of the 21st century. Issues such as climate change, terrorism, and cyber warfare cannot be fully understood or addressed through a purely realist lens. These challenges require multilateral cooperation and the involvement of non-state actors, which realism typically overlooks.

Joseph Nye’s concept of “smart power” offers an alternative approach to these global challenges. Nye argues that combining hard and soft power is essential for addressing issues like terrorism, which are rooted not only in power politics but also in ideological and cultural conflicts. Nye states that “power in the 21st century is about the ability to influence outcomes, not just through coercion or payment, but through attraction and persuasion” (Nye, 2009). This idea of combining military might with diplomacy and economic influence is particularly relevant in addressing challenges like climate change, which require global cooperation rather than unilateral action.

## Conclusion  
In conclusion, realism remains a valuable framework for understanding international relations, particularly in explaining power politics, state competition, and geopolitical rivalries like the one between the U.S. and China. Stephen Walt’s assertion that realism clarifies global politics is supported by historical and contemporary examples of state behavior, from U.S. interventions in Latin America to Cold War containment strategies. However, as the world becomes more interconnected and complex, realism’s state-centric focus and emphasis on military power are insufficient for addressing modern global challenges. Issues such as climate change, terrorism, and cyber warfare require multilateral cooperation, the involvement of non-state actors, and the integration of soft power alongside traditional hard power. As Joseph Nye argues, smart power — combining hard and soft power — is essential for navigating the complexities of international relations in the 21st century. While realism remains relevant, it must evolve to account for the diverse actors and issues shaping global governance today.
