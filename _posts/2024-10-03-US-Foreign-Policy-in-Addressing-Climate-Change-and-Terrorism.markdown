This article explores the evolution of American foreign policy in addressing two of the most significant global challenges of the 21st century: climate change and terrorism. While the United States has often positioned itself as a global leader, particularly through international agreements like the Paris Climate Accord and strategic military interventions in the war on terror, its approach has been inconsistent. Domestic political polarization and shifting global dynamics have frequently hampered sustained leadership. By analyzing the successes and setbacks across different administrations, this article argues that the U.S. struggles to maintain a coherent long-term strategy in addressing these complex issues, resulting in fragmented policies that undermine its global influence.


## Introduction
American foreign policy has driven global efforts to tackle two of the most critical challenges of the 21st century: climate change and terrorism. For decades, these issues have dominated international relations and national security agendas, with the U.S. playing a leading role in shaping global responses. However, the U.S. approach to both climate change and the war on terrorism has fluctuated, swinging between aggressive intervention and diplomatic retreat depending on the administration in power. This article argues that although the U.S. has led key initiatives to address these global crises, domestic political divisions and shifting global dynamics have weakened its ability to deliver consistent, long-term solutions. Through direct quotes and in-depth analysis, this article traces the evolution of U.S. foreign policy in these areas and assesses the successes and limitations of American leadership.

## The U.S. Role in Global Climate Policy: A Historical Perspective
The United States has consistently played a pivotal role in international climate negotiations, yet its commitment to addressing climate change has wavered based on domestic political factors and the administration in power. As early as the 1970s, the U.S. engaged in environmental conferences and signed treaties aimed at reducing environmental degradation. Thomas Robertson states, “The most obvious environmental dimensions of recent U.S. foreign relations have been the numerous international conferences and treaties on the environment, in which the U.S. government has taken part since the early 1970s” (Robertson, 2012). These efforts paved the way for landmark agreements like the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which sought to curb global greenhouse gas emissions.

However, the U.S. Congress refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, citing concerns over its economic impact and the exclusion of major developing nations, such as China and India, from binding emissions reduction targets. This reluctance to commit fully to international climate agreements reflected broader debates within the U.S. about balancing economic growth and environmental protection. As Robertson explains, “the economic reach of the United States had significant implications for land, water, and air, both overseas and at home,” underscoring the tension between U.S. economic interests and sustainability (Robertson, 2012).

Despite these hurdles, the U.S. remained involved in global climate diplomacy, particularly under the Obama administration. President Obama’s strong commitment to climate action culminated in the U.S. taking a central role in negotiating the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. William McAllister highlights this shift, noting, “Obama’s administration prioritized multilateral efforts and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, seeing climate change as a security threat and a moral obligation” (McAllister, 2012). This represented a significant departure from the previous Bush administration, which had distanced the U.S. from international climate accords.

## Trump’s Nationalist Approach to Climate Change
President Donald Trump’s election in 2016 brought a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy, particularly regarding environmental diplomacy. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017 marked a setback for global climate action, especially since the U.S. remains one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Trump framed the withdrawal as necessary to protect American jobs and industries, arguing that the agreement “unfairly disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries” (McAllister, 2012).

This nationalist approach epitomized Trump’s broader foreign policy, which prioritized immediate economic gains over long-term environmental sustainability. McAllister explains, “Trump’s policies on climate change focused on the immediate economic interests of the United States, often at the expense of global environmental commitments” (McAllister, 2012). By rolling back environmental regulations and promoting the fossil fuel industry, the Trump administration signaled a retreat from the U.S. role as a global leader in mitigating climate change.

Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement caused significant diplomatic consequences. Many international allies viewed the decision as a retreat from global leadership, damaging U.S. credibility in international climate negotiations. As a result, countries such as China and the European Union took on greater roles in leading the global fight against climate change. Walter Russell Mead remarks, “Trump’s foreign policy redefined U.S. alliances, focusing on renegotiating deals to ensure that the U.S. did not bear a disproportionate burden in global security matters, but this approach left significant gaps in areas like climate diplomacy” (PolicyExchangeUK, 2018).

## Biden’s Restoration of Climate Leadership
President Joe Biden’s administration quickly sought to reverse the environmental policies of his predecessor and reinstate U.S. leadership on climate change. On his first day in office, Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, signaling a renewed commitment to international cooperation on climate issues. McAllister observes, “Biden’s decision to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement reflects a return to multilateral diplomacy and recognition of climate change as an existential threat” (McAllister, 2012).

Biden’s climate agenda centers on transitioning the U.S. economy toward clean energy and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. His administration has pledged significant investments in renewable energy, the creation of green jobs, and stringent regulations on emissions from major industries. However, Biden faces stiff political resistance from Republicans and industry groups domestically, which complicates the implementation of his climate policies. Furthermore, Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement left doubts among international partners about the reliability of U.S. commitments to global climate action.

## The War on Terrorism: A Paradigm Shift in U.S. Foreign Policy
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, fundamentally reshaped U.S. foreign policy, as the country launched a global “war on terrorism.” The Bush administration responded swiftly and aggressively, leading military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. As de Mesquita points out, “terrorism is best understood as a tactic employed by insurgents and rebels, and the U.S. has responded by employing both military and diplomatic means to reduce the threat posed by these groups” (de Mesquita, 2013).

The invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 aimed to dismantle al-Qaeda and remove the Taliban from power, garnering wide international support. However, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, justified by claims that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, sparked controversy. The Iraq War toppled Hussein’s regime but plunged the country into insurgency and sectarian conflict. Goldberg notes that President Obama, upon assuming office, believed that “the Iraq War was a mistake and that U.S. military interventions in the Middle East had done more harm than good” (Goldberg, 2016).

Obama sought to end U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, focusing on more targeted counterterrorism operations. His administration increasingly relied on drone strikes and special operations to eliminate terrorist leaders, including the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden. As Goldberg points out, Obama’s approach represented a clear departure from Bush-era military interventions, as he believed that “military interventions should be limited and focused on specific objectives, rather than nation-building” (Goldberg, 2016).

## Trump’s Counterterrorism Strategy: A Transactional Approach
President Trump’s approach to counterterrorism followed a transactional philosophy, focusing on short-term military victories over long-term strategies. Trump escalated the use of airstrikes and drone warfare in the fight against ISIS but worked to reduce the U.S. military footprint in conflict zones. He repeatedly urged NATO allies to increase their financial contributions to military operations, arguing that the U.S. shouldered an unfair burden in global security matters.

Walter Russell Mead observes, “Trump’s foreign policy redefined U.S. alliances, focusing on renegotiating deals to ensure that the U.S. did not bear a disproportionate burden in global security matters” (PolicyExchangeUK, 2018). This approach aligned with Trump’s “America First” philosophy, which aimed to prioritize U.S. interests in all areas of foreign policy, including counterterrorism.

However, Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan provoked criticism from both Republicans and Democrats, who argued that the move would create power vacuums for terrorist groups to exploit. Dominic Tierney critiques Trump’s strategy, stating that “since 1945, the United States has experienced little except military stalemate and loss — precisely because it’s a superpower in a more peaceful world” (Tierney, 2015). This highlights the challenge the U.S. faces in balancing its military engagements with the need to avoid prolonged, costly conflicts.

## The Future of U.S. Foreign Policy: Navigating Global Challenges
As the Biden administration works to redefine U.S. foreign policy, it faces significant challenges in both climate diplomacy and counterterrorism. On climate change, Biden’s focus on multilateralism and clean energy investment offers a path forward, but domestic political opposition and the lingering effects of previous policies pose obstacles. McAllister underscores that “the U.S. will need to build trust with international partners and demonstrate its commitment to long-term climate action to maintain its leadership role” (McAllister, 2012).

In the realm of counterterrorism, the U.S. must navigate an increasingly complex global landscape, where non-state actors, authoritarian regimes, and regional conflicts continue to present security threats. De Mesquita asserts that “terrorism is not a static threat; it evolves in response to changes in global politics, economics, and technology” (de Mesquita, 2013). The U.S. must adapt its counterterrorism strategies to address these evolving challenges while avoiding the mistakes of past military interventions.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, American foreign policy has played a crucial role in addressing global challenges like climate change and terrorism. However, it has also faced significant obstacles, marked by inconsistent leadership and domestic political divisions. Moving forward, the U.S. must embrace a more consistent and collaborative approach to maintain its influence on the global stage. By prioritizing multilateralism, engaging international partners, and balancing domestic and global interests, the U.S. can continue to lead in addressing these pressing global challenges.
